This DLL library was developed as part of my Master thesis. It is a plant modeler plug-in for virtual reality system Vrecko. It is based on OpenSceneGraph. There is a parser for L-systems stored in LS or XML files. Many types of L-systems can be processed to generate a word. Word is then interpreted by turtle graphics. Interpretation process generates a geometry that is stored in scene graph. Vrecko then display this geometry.
